# HudsonRiverSFRAFFContentPack

**Hudson River & East River SFRA + Statue of Liberty**  
A ForeFlight Content Pack

Clean, accurate, color-coded reporting points and general navigation waypoints for safely and correctly flying the New York Class B Hudson River and East River Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA), including the exact Statue of Liberty orbit and SFRA exclusion boundaries.

Built for fixed-wing pilots who want to fly the Hudson corridor legally and with complete situational awareness.

### What this pack includes
- All official northbound and southbound Hudson River reporting points  
  (Alpine Tower → Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge)  
- East River reporting points (where fixed-wing remain allowed)  
- Statue of Liberty clockwise orbit waypoints (Liberty 1–9) at the correct 1,100 ft MSL radius  
- General navigation waypoints for common entry/exit routes and transitions  
- Skyline Transition entry/exit waypoints  
- SFRA exclusion boundary as a visible magenta polygon (matches the FAA chart exactly)

All points use the exact names and coordinates published on the current New York TAC and FAA SFRA documentation.
